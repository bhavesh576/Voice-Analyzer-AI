# 🤖 Gesture-Controlled Robotic System

> Control the future with your hands — no buttons, just gestures.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project uses **MediaPipe** and **JavaScript** to build a futuristic **gesture recognition system** that detects your hand movements in real-time via webcam and maps them to robotic or virtual actions. It’s a stepping stone to natural human-computer interaction — all through motion.
